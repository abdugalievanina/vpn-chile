Accessing the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) network from an off-campus location requires a secure and verified connection, which is established through the Mount Sinai VPN. This Virtual Private Network acts as a protected tunnel over the public internet, encrypting all data that travels between your device and the internal MSHS network. For faculty, students, and staff, using the Mount Sinai VPN is essential for accessing restricted resources such as shared drives, specific internal applications, and library databases that are normally only available on-site. This system ensures that all remote access is authenticated and secure, safeguarding sensitive institutional and patient information from unauthorized access.



The security of the network is paramount, which is why the Mount Sinai VPN service integrates robust security protocols. The primary function of the VPN is to create a secure, encrypted connection that shields your online activity from potential interception. To further enhance security, access is protected by multi-factor authentication (MFA), typically managed through the Duo Mobile application. This means that in addition to your standard Mount Sinai password, you must provide a secondary verification from your mobile device. This two-step process significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if a user's credentials become compromised, ensuring a high standard of data encryption and user verification.



Getting started with the Mount Sinai VPN involves a straightforward setup process. Authorized users must download and install the official VPN client, which is the Ivanti Secure Access Client (formerly known as Pulse Secure). This software is available for various operating systems, including Windows and macOS. The general steps for connecting are as follows:





Download the appropriate Ivanti Secure Access Client from the official Mount Sinai IT software page.


Install the application on your computer, following the on-screen prompts.


Launch the client and enter the correct server address provided by Mount Sinai IT.


Enter your Mount Sinai network credentials when prompted.


Approve the connection using the Duo Mobile push notification or passcode sent to your registered device.





To ensure a stable and secure connection while using the Mount Sinai VPN, it is important to follow best practices for remote work. Adhering to these guidelines helps maintain network integrity and optimizes performance for all users. If you encounter any issues with installation or connectivity, contacting Mount Sinai IT support is the recommended course of action. Key best practices include:





Disconnect when finished: Always disconnect from the VPN when you are done accessing internal resources. This frees up network licenses and bandwidth for other users.


Keep software updated: Ensure your Ivanti Secure Access Client and operating system are up to date to protect against security vulnerabilities.


Use on a secure network: Whenever possible, connect to the VPN from a trusted and secure Wi-Fi network rather than public, unsecured hotspots.


Report suspicious activity: If you notice any unusual behavior or receive unexpected authentication prompts, report it to the help desk immediately.
